# Growth

Growth is a life-planning app targeted at stressed out university students. As well as allowing students to regularly schedule their extra-curricular activities, the app allows them to upload Pdfs of their assignments and then plans their time in a healthy, productive fashion. When goals are met, their progress is measured and recorded on a supportive tree that grows as you do. 

As an added bonus, as you finish tasks you contribute to the environment, all ad revenue goes towards planting trees!
